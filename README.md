<h1>House Price Prediction</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
Project Overview:
Project Description:
This project leverages the Boston Housing dataset, which contains a variety of socio-economic and environmental variables related to housing in the Boston area. The dataset includes features such as per capita crime rate, average number of rooms per dwelling, proportion of residential land zoned for large lots, and other relevant indicators.

The primary objective is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates housing prices based on these input features.
Approach:
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and relationships.
Applied feature engineering and preprocessing techniques such as normalization and handling of multicollinearity.
Developed XGBoost regression model to predict housing prices.
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score.

<h2>Skills </h2>

- <b>Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)</b> 
- <b>Data preprocessing and feature selection</b>
- <b>XGBoost Regression modeling</b>
- <b>Model evaluation and validation</b>
- <b>Data visualization and storytelling</b>

<h2>Outcomes </h2>

- <b>Developed a robust regression model capable of predicting housing prices based on key attributes. The final model demonstrated strong predictive performance and can be further fine-tuned for deployment in real estate analytics or housing market research scenarios.</b>
